COMPILING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build, just type "make".  To install in "/usr/X11R6/bin", type
"make install".  The "gtk-config" program should be in your path.

The development environment for GTimer is Linux x86 2.0.36, libc6 (glibc),
and GTK 1.1.13.  It should build without issue on any UN*X that has GTK 1.1.13
or later.  Send me email if you would like to be notified of future releases.

To run:
	./gtimer


USING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command line options:
-midnight N	If you work past midnight, then use this to keep hours up
		until N count toward the previous day.
		Example:
		  -midnight 400
		  All hours up until 4AM will be applied to previous day.
-nosplash	Do not show the splash screen on app startup.
-start taskname	Start timing the specified task
-resume		Start timing the same tasks that were on when the application
		last exited.
-version	Display the gtimer version
-help		Get help on usage


TO DO:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add ability to group tasks by a group name.
- Catch some signals (SIGINT, for example) so we can save date before
  exiting.  GIMP does this, so it should be possible.
- Show the GNU license on initial run of the app.
- Online help.
- Postscript output for printing rather than plain text.
- GNOME integration.
- Make a smaller main window (like gtcd)
- Optionally store data in MySQL, Oracle, etc. instead of flat files
- Add a configuration window to set things like print command,
  idle timeout, etc.
- Export function (tab-delimited text file)
- Ability to edit existing annotations
